## TODO

- Replace placeholder images and YouTube embed ID.

- Swap the placeholder PDF at `public/media-kit/Daniel_Stoican_Raj_Media_Kit.pdf` for the real media kit.
- Connect the contact API route to an email service (Resend or Nodemailer).
- Update training environment and team details (coach, gym, location).
- Add real sponsor logos once confirmed.
